# goose roam — web client

A browser chat client that connects to a `goose roam share` agent **over iroh,
entirely in the browser** (iroh compiled to wasm, relay-only via
WebSocket-to-relay). No Tauri, no Electron, no local bridge process — the
browser tab itself is the roam peer.

The UI is a **React app that reuses goose's reference clients**, vendored under
`src/vendor/` (hand-synced copies from the goose repo; no path dependency):

- **`@aaif/goose-sdk`** (`src/vendor/goose-sdk`, via vite alias) —
  `GooseClient` is the protocol layer; our roam byte-duplex is exactly the
  `Stream` it expects.
- **`@desktop/*`** (`src/vendor/desktop`, imported as source) — the desktop's
  real `MarkdownContent` (react-markdown + remark-gfm + katex + syntax
  highlighting) renders agent messages; `ToolCallStatusIndicator` provides tool
  status dots; the desktop's full Tailwind v4 theme (`styles/main.css`) is
  imported so the components carry their real styles. A ~10-line
  `window.electron` shim (`shim.ts`) covers the Electron-only APIs
  `MarkdownContent` calls (`openExternal` → `window.open`), and `IntlProvider`
  renders react-intl `defaultMessage` fallbacks (no compiled catalog shipped).

Plus app-local widgets: tool-call cards that update in place, collapsible
thinking blocks, a plan checklist, inline non-blocking permission cards (never
`window.confirm`, which would freeze the ACP message pump), and a session
sidebar (list / load-with-history-replay / new).

Still stateless + CDN-hostable: static files only, no backend, all traffic
browser ⇄ relay ⇄ roam host. Still deliberately lean: main thread only, text
prompts, no reconnect. Hardening is tracked in `../README.md`.

The wasm module (`../goose-roaming-web`) does **only** the transport: hold a
roam identity keypair, decode a `goose+roam://` card, dial relay-only, run the
roam handshake, and expose a byte duplex. Everything ACP-shaped is the existing
TypeScript SDK. Nothing about the protocol is hand-rolled.

## Build & run

```bash
# 1. build the wasm transport module + generate JS bindings
#    (script is self-locating; run it from anywhere)
mobile-web/build-web.sh

# 2. run the app
cd mobile-web/webapp
pnpm install
pnpm dev                       # http://localhost:5178
```

`build-web.sh` compiles `goose-roaming-web` to wasm (via `build-wasm.sh`) and
runs `wasm-bindgen --target web` into `webapp/src/wasm/`.

## Pairing (two-way, like the CLI)

1. Open the app. It generates a per-browser roam identity (persisted in
   `localStorage`) and shows **this browser's key**.
2. On the host: `goose roam peers accept <that key>` (one time).
3. On the host: `goose roam id` → copy the `goose+roam://…` card.
4. Paste the card into the app → **connect**.

Both sides have chosen to trust the other's key — the same mutual card-swap two
CLIs do. The host runs the real agent (its tools, shell, cwd); the browser is a
pure ACP client.

## Smoke test (proves the wasm runs in a browser)

```bash
pnpm dev                       # in one shell (serves on :5178)
node tests/smoke.mjs           # in another
```

`tests/smoke.mjs` drives headless Google Chrome via Playwright (uses the
system Chrome via `channel: "chrome"`, so no `playwright install` needed) and
asserts the wasm instantiates, generates an ed25519 keypair, round-trips a
`goose+roam://` card through the decoder, and persists identity — with no
console errors. This isolates "does the browser wasm run" from the live
relay/handshake path.

## Status

Proven end to end. Build-time green (`tsc` clean vs ACP SDK 0.19.0,
Vite bundles), in-browser wasm runtime green (`tests/smoke.mjs`), and a **live
round trip green** (`tests/e2e.mjs`: real Chrome → managed relay → running
`goose roam share` → agent response). `tests/visual.mjs` captures the rendered
GUI (markdown + tool widget + session sidebar) as a screenshot.

Hardening tracked in `../README.md`: Web Worker, reconnect, backpressure
tuning, key security, revocation-closes-connections.
